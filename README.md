Project-Thingy!

##Wouldn’t it be cool, if you have an always-in-sync, plus always-in-hand idea-pad that you can record any spark down instantly?

Project Thingy is firstly an idea recorder. All the users have the convenience to record their ideas. You can choose your ideas to be public, or private. All of your ideas will be automatically-synced between all your devices, no matter if it’s a phone, a tablet, or a Mac. Don’t forget to lay your iPad at your bedside just in case you’ve got a brilliant idea in your dream and it faded away on your way to pen n’ paper!

##Wouldn’t it be cool, if your idea is held under a source version control, and you have a chance to evident it evolve to its finest?

You’ll be really surprised at how fast and how inconsistent an idea will change. Laugh at how boring or nonsensical your ideas originally were, and be amazed at how you paved your way out through the process.

##Wouldn’t it be cool, if you can share your ideas to the wide public, and people can easily “fork” your idea and continue to work on it?

You’ll be surprised to see that your idea has been worked on so hard and it has already turned so wild that you have never expected before. Of course, everybody has right to lock his/her ideas up, but why not push it to public? You’ll be amazed on how astonishing they have turned into. Don’t worry, the initial idea will be automatically-TMed!

##Wouldn’t it be cool, if you want to do something meaningful but figure out that you have no idea where to start with?

Project Thingy is a community-based idea factory. Any user has the right to thumb up and thumb down an idea. There will be a bulletin of all the best ideas that got voted out by the community. And the board will digest the most innovative and craziest ideas out by sending a monthly newsletter. Who knows, you may make a fortune with one or two of them!

##Wouldn’t it be cool, if any idea can be stored and shared?

We decided at the beginning, that project thingy will have no requirement whatsoever on the quality of your ideas. Your idea can lead us to a domestic atomic fusion device, or to be filmed at the next episode of Jack-ass. Why, stupid ideas can be cool too!
