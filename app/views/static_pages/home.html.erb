      Project Thingy is firstly an idea recorder. All the users have the
      convenience to record their ideas. You can choose your ideas to be
      public, or private. All of your ideas will be automatically-synced
      between all your devices, no matter if it’s a phone, a tablet, or
      a Mac. Don’t forget to lay your iPad at your bedside just in case
      you’ve got a brilliant idea in your dream and it faded away on your way
      to pen n’ paper!
